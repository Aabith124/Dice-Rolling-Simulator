Dice Rolling Simulator (Java)

A simple terminal-based dice rolling simulator built in Java. This project allows users to roll multiple dice, specifying the number of dice to roll in real-time. The dice faces are displayed using ASCII art, and the outcomes are randomized using Java’s Random class to ensure fairness.

Key Features:

Roll multiple dice at once with a customizable dice count
Realistic dice faces rendered in ASCII format
Randomized results using Java’s Random class
Input validation with exception handling to ensure error-free usage
This project is a great way to practice Java fundamentals, including random number generation, input validation, and terminal-based application design.

Feel free to fork the repository, contribute, or explore the code!
